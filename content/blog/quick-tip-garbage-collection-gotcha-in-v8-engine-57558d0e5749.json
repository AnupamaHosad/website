        "<p>Have you ever come across a variable that was undefined or not available when inspecting with the debugger in Chrome developer tools ? Or, maybe the variable contained a value that you did not expect ?</p><p>Before you think there is a bug in your application logic and spend hours debugging it, wait! Just read further to understand why this happens!</p><p>The V8 engine (which is the Javascript engine in Chrome browser), does a garbage collection of variables that are no longer used and hence some variables might not be available or might have a different value than expected when you are debugging it using Chrome debugger. This is an optimization that is done by the V8 engine which is a feature and not a bug ;-)</p><p>What you can do in such cases is to just console.log the variable whose value you want to inspect instead of checking via the debugger.</p><p>Hope this saved some time that you might have spent in debugging an issue that is actually not a issue!</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=57558d0e5749\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"
